smarflash recognizes r0kets in firmware flash or mass storage flash mode and flashes them to factory defaults with a new generated random crypto key.

Runs only under linux (sorry, but requires /sys/... stuff)

You NEED to disable your automounter and run it as root.

Disabling automounter on ubuntu 10.4: 
	run gconf-editor
	apps > nautilus > preferences

	media_automount = OFF
	media_automount_open = OFF
	media_autorun_never = ON 

run "make setup" to generate/gathe the necessary files
then run "./smarflash" and flash away.


TODO ideas:
- keep cryptokey if already there.
- ability to format if not? Or somehow force formatting?
- fix broken FS: save config/keys // reformat // copy back
